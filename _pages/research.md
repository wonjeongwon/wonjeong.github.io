## The Mixed Effects of the Second Gender Revolution: Stagnated Gender Earnings Gap among College Graduates 1980s-2010s (working paper)

**Short abstract**

Over the past decades, the economic foundations of marriage have shifted, pointing to greater gender equality in marriage. Good economic prospects for women now are associated with more marriage and parenthood. The Second Gender Revolution perspective posits that college graduates now have more gender-equal relationships within the household. On the other hand, the convergence of the gender pay gap has been the slowest among highly educated women and men in the United States. This paper examines the extent to which increases in marriage and parenthood among college-graduate women have slowed the pace of change in gender earnings equality among college graduates. Using the Current Population Survey in the early 1980s and late 2010s, this paper shows preliminary evidence that 1) women's increased family formation partially hampered the decrease in gender earnings gap among college graduates, and 2) the decreased negative association between family formation and earnings for women contributed to the decrease. By focusing on changing family formation patterns, this paper argues that the Second Gender Revolution has been a two-sided coin. It increased labor market opportunities for highly-educated women, while stalling progress due to the remaining gender gap after family formation.
