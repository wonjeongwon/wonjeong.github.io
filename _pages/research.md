# Demographic Transition and Gender Inequality in the US

## The Mixed Effects of the Second Gender Revolution: Stagnated Gender Earnings Gap among College Graduates 1980s-2010s (working paper)

**Short abstract**

Over the past decades, the economic foundations of marriage have shifted, pointing to greater gender equality in marriage. Good economic prospects for women now are associated with more marriage and parenthood. The Second Gender Revolution perspective posits that college graduates now have more gender-equal relationships within the household. On the other hand, the convergence of the gender pay gap has been the slowest among highly educated women and men in the United States. This paper examines the extent to which increases in marriage and parenthood among college-graduate women have slowed the pace of change in gender earnings equality among college graduates. Using the Current Population Survey in the early 1980s and late 2010s, this paper shows preliminary evidence that 1) women's increased family formation partially hampered the decrease in gender earnings gap among college graduates, and 2) the decreased negative association between family formation and earnings for women contributed to the decrease. By focusing on changing family formation patterns, this paper argues that the Second Gender Revolution has been a two-sided coin. It increased labor market opportunities for highly-educated women, while stalling progress due to the remaining gender gap after family formation.


# Taking a Couple-level Perspective on Gender Inequality (w/ Kelly Musick)

## State-level Gender Inequality and Couples' Relative Earnings Following Parenthood 
**Short Abstract**
We leverage state and regional variation in gender inequality to identify characteristics that shape patterns of family change and inequality at the couple level. We focus on the moderating role of gender context as measured by parenthood wage gaps, parenthood employment penalties, early family formation, and attitudes about working mothers on changes in couples’ relative earnings following first birth. Our study relies on newly available identifiers in the Current Population Survey (CPS) to link couples longitudinally across the 16 months of their participation in the survey from 1982-2020. The large, overlapping panels of the CPS allow us to observe the critical window of new parenthood in samples large enough to assess contextual variation at the state level. Our findings suggest that state and regional context shapes couples’ responses to birth, with greater within-household inequality in earnings following parenthood among couples living in states with fewer working mothers and regions with less progressive attitudes about working mothers.

## His and Her Long Work Hours and Short-Term Employment Changes Following First Birth 
**Short Abstract**
We build on recent research emphasizing the role of long and inflexible work hours in constraining women’s employment and exacerbating gender inequalities in employment and earnings. Our analysis draws on a couple perspective and focuses on how own and partner long work hours shape employment following the transition to parenthood. Data from the Current Population Survey panels from 1982-2018 (N =150,988 couple years) allow us to measure employment and work hours of both partners shortly before and after first birth over the span of nearly four decades. We find that wives’ employment and work hours following birth are shaped by partners’ work hours, with mothers pulling back from work to a greater extent when their partners work long hours. Husbands’ employment and work hours, by contrast, are not sensitive to partners’ work hours. We find increases in wives’ work hours but not husbands’ over time, and little evidence of change over time in the moderating role of partners’ hours on own employment following birth. Our results are consistent with earlier findings about the importance of husbands’ work hours for wives’ employment. They shed new light on couple dynamics at the critical transition to parenthood and document surprising continuity in husbands’ work hour patterns and associations with wives’ employment over time.


## Couples' Earnings and Mothers' and Fathers' Labor Market Attachment Following First Birth
**Short Abstract**
A couple perspective is critical for understanding how families strategize about work and earnings after childbirth, yet the bulk of the literature on the economic costs of parenthood focuses on individuals. We address this gap, examining short-term changes over four decades in mothers’ and fathers’ employment following the critical transition to parenthood. Our analysis assesses the extent to which job exits and work hours changes among new parents are shaped by their own and their partners’ earnings, and whether changes associated with having a high-earning spouse are moderated by own earnings. It relies on a sample of couples from the Current Population Survey (CPS) panels from 1982-2020, which allows us to observe couples’ work and earnings before and after the transition to first birth. Consistent with expectations from economic theory, mothers’ work attachment is stronger as her own earnings increase and weaker as her partners’ earnings increase. The estimated effects of having a high-earning spouse, however, are moderated to some extent by wives’ own high earnings. New fathers’ employment and earnings change little after birth and are weakly associated with his own or partners’ earnings. These processes have changed little overall across four decades, although with some recent suggestion that the effect of his earnings may be waning.
